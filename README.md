## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used this project to focus on my use of position relative and absolute as this is something I have been learning recently. I used position absolute to position the profile image, which helped me to understand how absolute is dependent on the parent element (but only if the parent element has the property position: relative assigned to it). I also used the fixed position property to position the background elements into one place but this then become less responsive.

### Continued development

I added a white border to the profile image but as you can see from the screenshot, this left a gap between the image and the border, so that the cyan background is seeping through - I couldn't work out why that was happening so I would be grateful for some feedback on this. I also struggled to get the background patterns to respond to a shrinking window (probably because it was in a fixed position) - so I still need to develop my understanding of background image positioning.
